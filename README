This is woefully incomplete.

If you are using Fx, you need to use a WebSocket Flash emulator and thus you
will need to serve a Flash policy. A simple policy server is shipped in this
package, try:
$ sudo twistd -ny policy.tac

To start the server, running in WebSocket mode on port 8888, do:
$ sudo twistd -ny proxy.tac

There's no way to configure that at the moment. We'll have a config file as
soon as we figure out what should go in it.
