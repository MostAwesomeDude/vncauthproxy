This is woefully incomplete.

If you are using Fx, you need to use a WebSocket Flash emulator and thus you
will need to serve a Flash policy. A simple policy server is shipped in this
package, try:
$ sudo twistd -n flashpolicy

To start the server, try:
$ twistd -n vncap

By default, the daemon runs in WebSocket mode on TCP port 8888, bound to
localhost. It can be customized to target any endpoint; here are some
examples.

Running on TCP port 8000, bound to localhost:
$ twistd -n vncap -c tcp:8000:interface=localhost

Running on a local UNIX socket:
$ twistd -n vncap -c unix:/tmp/vncap.sock

Requirements:

 * Twisted 10.2 or newer

If your distribution insists on splitting Twisted into multiple packages, you
will also need the Twisted Web package, usually called python-twisted-web.
