===============================================
Twisted VNC Authentication Proxy (TVAP) (VNCAP)
===============================================

This is woefully incomplete.

If you are using Fx, you need to use a WebSocket Flash emulator and thus you
will need to serve a Flash policy. A simple policy server is shipped in this
package, try:
$ sudo twistd -n flashpolicy

To start the server, try:
$ twistd -n vncap

By default, the daemon runs on TCP port 8888, bound only to localhost. Here
are some examples for customizing the control port:

Running on TCP port 8000, bound to localhost:
$ twistd -n vncap -c tcp:8000:interface=localhost

Running on a local UNIX socket:
$ twistd -n vncap -c unix:/tmp/vncap.sock

Requirements:

 * Twisted 10.2 or newer

If your distribution insists on splitting Twisted into multiple packages, you
will also need the Twisted Web package, usually called python-twisted-web.

Controlling the Proxy
=====================

To command the proxy to open ports, a JSON snippet should be sent to the
control port. The snippet should be a JSON dictionary, with the following
required keys:

* ``daddr``: The destination hostname for the VNC backend
* ``dport``: The destination port for the VNC backend
* ``password``: A password for the VNC frontend conection

The following keys are optional:

* ``sport``: The preferred source port for the VNC frontend
* ``ws``: Whether the frontend should be wrapped for WebSockets
* ``tls``: Whether the frontend should be wrapped with TLS for SSL/WSS

If the requsted ``sport`` is not available, one will be automatically
assigned.

TLS
===

If TLS is requested, the proxy will look for SSL key and certificate
information from hardcoded locations. The locations for the SSL files are:

* ``keys/vncap.key``: SSL key
* ``keys/vncap.crt``: SSL certificate

To generate simple keys, an example series of OpenSSL invocations might be::

 $ openssl genrsa -out keys/vncap.key 1024
 $ openssl req -new -key keys/vncap.key -out keys/vncap.csr
 $ openssl x509 -req -in keys/vncap.csr -signkey keys/vncap.key -out
   keys/vncap.crt
